# Python O(1) Memory cat.py

Instructions:

1. The `cat.py` file is an O(n) memory implementation of the `cat` command line utility.
    Veryify that it works by running the commands
    ```
    $ python3 cat.py README.md
    $ python3 cat.py cat.py
    ```

2. Observe that this command fails the github actions test case because it uses O(n) memory.

3. Fix the `cat.py` file so that the github actions are passing.

4. Modify this file to include an image demonstrating that your testcases are passing on github actions.

5. Upload the url to your completed repo to sakai.
